# Verify your Smart Contract on Etherscan --takes 5 min.

> Why do it? -- Coz' you wanna look legit.

Think like this, why would I connect my wallet to a random website which only god knows
what the heck it does ??? -- 99% will just bounce, no matter how good your idea is.

But, what if you drop a link to your verified smart contract on Etherscan where anyone can
go + check out your actual code -- suddenly, you are legit.

Now, I am not so afraid to connect my wallet -- <s>steal</s> take my crypto dude, I believe yaaa.
